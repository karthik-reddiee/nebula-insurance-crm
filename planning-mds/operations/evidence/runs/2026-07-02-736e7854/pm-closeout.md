## Archive Decision

Do not archive the feature folder yet. F0028 is implemented and approved, but remains in the active planning tree until tracker/archive movement is explicitly requested.

## Deferred Follow-ups

- Upgrade inherited `Microsoft.OpenApi 2.0.0` advisory.
- Run full regression suites before wider release merge.
- Add dedicated CI scanner automation.
- Evaluate inline edit affordances for high-frequency child collection updates after operator feedback.

## Recommendation Acceptances

- Accepted: Run the complete backend and frontend regression suites before merging F0028 into a release branch - accepted as release validation follow-up.
- Accepted: Add a reusable test environment variable for Vitest localStorage setup - accepted as test harness hardening.
- Accepted: Apply the EF migration in staging with normal database backup/rollback procedure - accepted as release deployment plan.
- Accepted: Keep the Authentik local bootstrap repair documented for future developer environments - accepted as developer runbook update.
- Accepted: Run the full backend and frontend regression suites before release merge - accepted as release validation follow-up.
- Accepted: Consider adding inline edit affordances for child collection rows if operators need high-frequency contact/appetite/appointment edits after MVP use - accepted as post-MVP UX feedback item.
- Accepted: Upgrade or replace inherited `Microsoft.OpenApi 2.0.0` dependency outside F0028 - accepted as dependency-maintenance follow-up; mitigation: inherited advisory does not block this feature closeout.
- Accepted: Add CI scanner automation for dependency, secrets, SAST, and DAST evidence - accepted as security pipeline hardening.
- Accepted: Re-run unauthenticated and role-scoped endpoint checks in staging after migration application - accepted as staging validation follow-up.
- Accepted: coverage - accepted focused coverage waiver for local feature action closeout; Quality Engineer owns release-suite follow-up.
