|------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| G0 | PASS | Architect | 2026-07-02T19:58:53+05:30 | Feature assembly plan created from approved Phase B artifacts and existing code patterns; required signoff roles initialized. | No | Proceed to G1 runtime preflight. |
| G1 | PASS | Architect | 2026-07-02T20:13:29+05:30 | Runtime preflight passed after local `.env` restoration and missing Authentik database repair; required services are up and API `/healthz` returns `200 Healthy`. | No | Proceed to implementation roles, starting with KG hints before code edits. |
| G2 | PASS | Quality Engineer | 2026-07-02T20:45:00+05:30 | Implementation self-review, focused backend tests, frontend build/tests, and runtime smoke checks passed with documented warnings. | No | Carry existing dependency/build warnings into review evidence. |
| G3 | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | Code Reviewer | 2026-07-02T20:46:00+05:30 | Backend, frontend, persistence, search projection, authorization, and migration changes are consistent with local patterns. | No | Follow up on full-suite regression coverage and dependency advisory outside this feature slice. |
| G4 | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | Security Reviewer | 2026-07-02T20:47:00+05:30 | F0028 endpoints are policy protected, commercially sensitive data remains internal, and unauthenticated access returns `401`; scan limitations are recorded. | No | Upgrade inherited Microsoft.OpenApi package and add CI scanner automation in dependency-maintenance work. |
| G5 | PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | Product Manager | 2026-07-02T20:48:00+05:30 | Required role evidence is present and non-blocking recommendations are accepted. | No | Track deferred carrier sync/rating/reinsurance out of scope. |
| G6 | PASS | Architect | 2026-07-02T20:49:00+05:30 | Feature action implementation completed across API, persistence, frontend, migration, tests, and evidence. | No | Proceed to KG reconciliation. |
| G7 | PASS | Architect | 2026-07-02T20:50:00+05:30 | KG coverage report refreshed; KG validation and drift checks pass with pre-existing warnings documented. | No | Proceed to PM closeout. |
| G8 | APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS | Product Manager | 2026-07-02T20:51:00+05:30 | F0028 is complete for CRM-side carrier and market relationship management; remaining recommendations are non-blocking maintenance items. | No | Keep dependency and full regression follow-ups outside F0028 closeout. |
