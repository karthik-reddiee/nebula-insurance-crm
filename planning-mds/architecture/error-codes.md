# Nebula CRM — Error Codes (MVP)

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for ProblemDetails `code` values used in MVP.
**Scope:** Global API ProblemDetails `code` values.

## Usage

- Returned in RFC 7807 ProblemDetails `code` field.
- Status codes are included here for clarity; the HTTP response is authoritative.
- Error responses use `application/problem+json`.

## Status Code Policy

- `400`: malformed request or baseline validation failure.
- `401`: missing/invalid/expired authentication.
- `403`: authenticated but forbidden (policy or scope failure).
- `404`: resource absent or intentionally hidden.
- `409`: business/workflow conflict.
- `412`: failed precondition (for example `If-Match` mismatch).
- `422`: semantic/domain validation failure.
- `429`: rate limit exceeded.
- `500`: unexpected server failure.
- `503`: dependency/service unavailable.

## Notes

- Add new codes here when new stories introduce deterministic error cases.
- Keep codes stable once released to avoid breaking client-side error handling.
- For `403`, always return a subtype `code` (at minimum `policy_denied`).
