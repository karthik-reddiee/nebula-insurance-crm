### 2.1a Distribution Hierarchy, Producer Ownership, and Territory (F0017)

F0017 introduces structural distribution data and effective-dated ownership/territory records. Per ADR-026, hierarchy-aware read scoping is deferred to F0037; F0017 reads are authenticated internal-only, while mutations are limited to DistributionManager and Admin.

| Role | Resource | Action | Decision | Business Scope / Constraints | Story / AC Reference |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| DistributionUser | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | read | **ALLOW** | Authenticated internal read; no hierarchy-aware subtree scoping in F0017. | F0017-S0002, S0003, S0004; ADR-026 §6 |
| DistributionUser | distribution_node:update / producer_ownership:assign / territory:create / territory:assign | mutate | **DENY** | Structural hierarchy, ownership, and territory mutations are manager-owned in MVP+. | F0017-S0001, S0003, S0004 |
| DistributionManager | distribution_node | read / update | **ALLOW** | May read full tree and set/clear parent on active nodes; cycle/self-parent/orphan rules still apply. | F0017-S0001, S0002 |
| DistributionManager | producer_ownership | read / assign | **ALLOW** | May assign/reassign producer ownership with effective dates; overlap/backdating rules still apply. | F0017-S0003 |
| DistributionManager | territory | read / create / assign | **ALLOW** | May create territories and assign members with effective dates; duplicate/overlap rules still apply. | F0017-S0004 |
| Underwriter | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | read | **ALLOW** | Authenticated internal read for operational context; no mutation. | F0017-S0002, S0003, S0004; ADR-026 §6 |
| Underwriter | distribution_node:update / producer_ownership:assign / territory:create / territory:assign | mutate | **DENY** | Read-only context. | F0017-S0001, S0003, S0004 |
| RelationshipManager | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | read | **ALLOW** | Authenticated internal read for broker/account relationship context; no mutation. | F0017-S0002, S0003, S0004 |
| RelationshipManager | distribution_node:update / producer_ownership:assign / territory:create / territory:assign | mutate | **DENY** | Relationship managers do not change distribution structure in this slice. | F0017-S0001, S0003, S0004 |
| ProgramManager | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | read | **ALLOW** | Authenticated internal read for program context; no mutation. | F0017-S0002, S0003, S0004 |
| ProgramManager | distribution_node:update / producer_ownership:assign / territory:create / territory:assign | mutate | **DENY** | Program managers are read-only for this structural model. | F0017-S0001, S0003, S0004 |
| Admin | distribution_node | read / update | **ALLOW** | Full internal read and mutation; validation and concurrency rules still apply. | F0017-S0001, S0002 |
| Admin | producer_ownership | read / assign | **ALLOW** | Full internal read and mutation; effective-date rules still apply. | F0017-S0003 |
| Admin | territory | read / create / assign | **ALLOW** | Full internal read and mutation; duplicate/overlap rules still apply. | F0017-S0004 |
| BrokerUser | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | all | **DENY** | F0017 data is InternalOnly; external portal and hierarchy-aware broker visibility are deferred. | F0017 PRD Out of Scope; ADR-026 §6 |
| ExternalUser | distribution_node / producer_ownership / territory | all | **DENY** | No external broker/MGA self-service portal in MVP. | BLUEPRINT §3.1 non-goals |

**Constraints applying to all F0017 ALLOW decisions:**
- Reads are authenticated internal-only and intentionally not hierarchy/territory scoped until F0037.
- `distribution_node:update` requires `If-Match`; stale versions return `precondition_failed` (412).
- `producer_ownership:assign` and `territory:assign` close prior effective-dated periods and open new periods transactionally; overlap conflicts return 409 and semantic date errors return 422.
- Every successful mutation emits an immutable ActivityTimelineEvent atomically with the mutation; rejected mutations emit no event.

### 2.6a Task — Manager Assignment (F0004 Delta)

F0004 extends the self-assigned-only task model with creator-based access for DistributionManager and Admin.

| Role | Action | Decision | Business Scope / Constraints | Story / AC Reference |
|------|--------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| DistributionManager | create (assign to other) | **ALLOW** | Can assign tasks to any active internal user. Target user must exist and be active. | F0004-S0003 |
| DistributionManager | read (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Tasks where `CreatedByUserId` = authenticated user. | F0004-S0003 |
| DistributionManager | update (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Tasks where `CreatedByUserId` = authenticated user. Can edit fields and reassign. Cannot change status (assignee-only). | F0004-S0003 |
| DistributionManager | delete (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Tasks where `CreatedByUserId` = authenticated user. Soft delete only. | F0004-S0003 |
| Admin | create (assign to other) | **ALLOW** | Same as DistributionManager. | F0004-S0003 |
| Admin | read (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Tasks where `CreatedByUserId` = authenticated user. | F0004-S0003 |
| Admin | update (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Same as DistributionManager. | F0004-S0003 |
| Admin | delete (created tasks) | **ALLOW** | Same as DistributionManager. | F0004-S0003 |
| DistributionUser | create (assign to other) | **DENY** | Self-assigned only. | F0004-S0003 |
| Underwriter | create (assign to other) | **DENY** | Self-assigned only. | F0004-S0003 |
| RelationshipManager | create (assign to other) | **DENY** | Self-assigned only. | F0004-S0003 |
| ProgramManager | create (assign to other) | **DENY** | Self-assigned only. | F0004-S0003 |

**Constraints applying to F0004 ALLOW decisions:**
- Self-assigned task rules (§2.6) remain active. A request is allowed if it satisfies EITHER self-assigned rules OR creator-based rules (OR semantics in Casbin).
- Creator-based access applies only when `CreatedByUserId = authenticated user`. Managers cannot access tasks created by other managers.
- Reassignment: only the creator (DistributionManager/Admin) can change `AssignedToUserId`. Assignees cannot reassign.
- Status change: only the current assignee (`AssignedToUserId = authenticated user`) can change status. Creator attempting status change on a task assigned to someone else returns 403 (`status_change_restricted`).
- Assignee validation: target user must exist in UserProfile and have `IsActive = true`. Inactive assignee returns 422 (`inactive_assignee`). Non-existent user returns 422 (`invalid_assignee`).
- Reassignment emits `TaskReassigned` timeline event with previous/new assignee details.
- `GET /my/tasks` (dashboard widget) is unchanged and returns only self-assigned tasks (assignee-based).
- `GET /tasks?view=assignedByMe` returns only creator-based tasks where assignee ≠ creator (requires DistributionManager/Admin role).

**Constraints applying to all ALLOW decisions on Submission:**
- Invalid transition pairs return HTTP 409 with ProblemDetails code invalid_transition. (BLUEPRINT §4.3)
- Missing transition prerequisites return HTTP 409 with ProblemDetails code missing_transition_prerequisite. (BLUEPRINT §4.3)

### 2.9 Renewal — Read / Create / Update / Transition / Assign (F0007, F0034)

Applies to the F0007 Renewal Pipeline endpoints: `GET /renewals`, `POST /renewals`, `GET /renewals/{renewalId}`, `PUT /renewals/{renewalId}/lob-attributes`, `POST /renewals/{renewalId}/transitions`, `PUT /renewals/{renewalId}/assignment`, `GET /renewals/{renewalId}/timeline`.

| ExternalUser | all | **DENY** | No external portal in MVP. | BLUEPRINT §3.1 non-goals |

**Constraints applying to all ALLOW decisions on Renewal:**
- Role gating on transitions is enforced in the application layer via `WorkflowStateMachine.ValidateRenewalTransition` in addition to Casbin policy. Distribution roles cannot perform Underwriter-owned transitions and vice versa.
- One active (non-deleted, non-terminal) renewal per `PolicyId` is enforced via filtered unique index `IX_Renewals_PolicyId_Active`. Duplicate creation returns HTTP 409 with code `duplicate_renewal`.
- Lost transitions require `lostReasonCode`; Completed transitions require `boundPolicyId` (and may include `renewalSubmissionId`). Missing fields return HTTP 409 with code `missing_transition_prerequisite`. (BLUEPRINT §4.3)
- Invalid transition pairs return HTTP 409 with code `invalid_transition`. (BLUEPRINT §4.3)
- Assignment of a terminal-state renewal (`Completed`, `Lost`) returns HTTP 409 with code `assignment_not_allowed_in_terminal_state`.
- State-changing mutations (`PUT /renewals/{renewalId}/lob-attributes`, `POST /renewals/{renewalId}/transitions`, `PUT /renewals/{renewalId}/assignment`) require `If-Match` and return HTTP 412 `precondition_failed` on stale rowVersion values. (API Guidelines + F0007 architecture)
- Every successful transition appends a `WorkflowTransition` and `ActivityTimelineEvent` record. Assignment changes append an `ActivityTimelineEvent`. (BLUEPRINT §4.3)
- Per-LOB timing windows (`WorkflowSlaThreshold` keyed on `LineOfBusiness`) drive overdue/approaching computation; defaults are used when no LOB-specific row exists. (ADR-009, ADR-014)

### 2.9a Renewal — Draft Outreach (F0038, ADR-027 + ADR-028)

New dedicated, least-privilege action `renewal:draft_outreach`. Gates **both** the
persist-draft endpoint (`POST /renewals/{renewalId}/outreach-draft`, F0038-S0005)
and the mock-send endpoint (`POST /renewals/{renewalId}/outreach-mock-send`,
F0038-S0006). Distinct from `renewal:transition`. Called by the Neuron service as
the user (forwarded authentik token); the engine enforces this Casbin rule — no
authorization is re-implemented in Python.

| Role | Action | Decision | Business Scope / Constraints | Story / AC Reference |
|------|--------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Underwriter | draft_outreach | **ALLOW** | Renewal owner. May draft (persist InternalOnly AI-generated `ActivityTimelineEvent` with provenance) and mock-send. Mock-send commits the real `Identified → Outreach` transition + a "sent (simulated)" event and **fakes SMTP** (no real email). | F0038-S0005, F0038-S0006; intake decisions B/C |
| DistributionUser | draft_outreach | **DENY** | No draft rights in v1. "Refer draft to Distribution for review" is a future feature. | F0038 intake decision C |
| DistributionManager | draft_outreach | **DENY** | No draft rights in v1. | F0038 intake decision C |
| RelationshipManager | draft_outreach | **DENY** | Read-only in MVP. | F0038 scope |
| ProgramManager | draft_outreach | **DENY** | Read-only in MVP. | F0038 scope |
| Admin | draft_outreach | **ALLOW** | Unscoped. | ADR-028 §3 |
| ExternalUser | draft_outreach | **DENY** | No external portal in MVP. | BLUEPRINT §3.1 non-goals |

**Constraints applying to `renewal:draft_outreach`:**
- **Outreach-commit exception (ADR-028 §3):** `WorkflowStateMachine.ValidateRenewalTransition`
  permits `Identified → Outreach` for an **Underwriter** **only** when performed
  through the outreach-mock-send path under `renewal:draft_outreach` authority. The
  general `renewal:transition` ownership split (Distribution owns
  `Identified ↔ Outreach ↔ InReview`) is **unchanged** for every other path. This
  is the deliberate F0038↔F0007 reconciliation: in commercial P&C the underwriter
  owns the renewal, so a dedicated single-purpose grant honors the locked intake
  without widening general transition rights.
- Draft content must not state/imply premium, quote figures, coverage terms, or
  any binding commitment (engine-validated; 422 on violation). Drafts are
  `InternalOnly` and labelled "AI-generated draft" until a human edits/approves.
- Drafting does **not** transition; the transition fires only on mock-send.
- Mock-send is atomic (transition + both events all-or-nothing) and requires
  `If-Match` (rowVersion); invalid state → 409 `invalid_transition`.
- Every draft and mock-send emits provenance (actor, model, prompt id/version,
  content hash). Under no circumstance is a real email dispatched in v1.

### 2.10 BrokerUser (Phase 1 Delta — F0009)

This section applies only when F0009 is enabled. It does not alter MVP InternalOnly rules for existing external users by default.

| Role | Resource | Action | Decision | Business Scope / Constraints | Story / AC Reference |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| BrokerUser | broker | read / search | **ALLOW** | Only broker records mapped to authenticated broker identity; no cross-broker visibility. | F0009-S0004 |
| BrokerUser | broker | create / update / delete / reactivate | **DENY** | BrokerUser is read-first in Phase 1. | F0009 PRD Out of Scope; F0009-S0004 |
| BrokerUser | contact | read | **ALLOW** | Only contacts for broker-visible broker records. Internal-only fields masked/omitted. | F0009-S0004 |
| BrokerUser | contact | create / update / delete | **DENY** | No broker-side contact mutations in this phase. | F0009 PRD Out of Scope |
| BrokerUser | dashboard_kpi | read | **DENY** | KPI response aggregates submission and renewal data (both DENY resources). Endpoint shape cannot be safely filtered in Phase 1 — returning only `activeBrokers` would require a new endpoint contract. | F0009-S0003, F0009-S0004; F-006 Resolution |
| BrokerUser | dashboard_pipeline | read | **DENY** | Pipeline response is entirely submission/renewal status counts. No BrokerVisible field exists in this response shape. | F0009-S0003, F0009-S0004; F-006 Resolution |
| BrokerUser | dashboard_nudge | read | **ALLOW** | Mandatory server-side scope filter: return only `OverdueTask` nudges where `linkedEntityType = 'Broker'` AND `linkedEntityId` is within the authenticated BrokerUser's resolved broker scope. `StaleSubmission` and `UpcomingRenewal` nudge types must be excluded. If broker scope is empty, return empty array — not 403. All NudgeCard fields are BrokerVisible; InternalOnly protection is at nudge type filter level. | F0009-S0004; F-006 Resolution |
| BrokerUser | timeline_event | read | **ALLOW** | Only events explicitly classified BrokerVisible. | F0009-S0004 |

| BrokerUser | submission | transition | **DENY** | No workflow transitions by BrokerUser in Phase 1. | F0009 PRD Out of Scope |
| BrokerUser | renewal | read | **DENY** | Renewal self-service is out of scope for this feature phase. | F0009 PRD Out of Scope |
| BrokerUser | renewal | transition | **DENY** | No workflow transitions by BrokerUser in Phase 1. | F0009 PRD Out of Scope |

**Constraints applying to all BrokerUser ALLOW decisions:**
- Default deny applies for any resource/action not explicitly listed as ALLOW above.
- Server-side ABAC enforcement is authoritative; frontend hiding is defense-in-depth only.
- BrokerUser tenant scope must resolve from authenticated `broker_tenant_id` claim.
- If `broker_tenant_id` is missing, unknown, or maps ambiguously, access is denied.
- Enforcement order is fixed: tenant query isolation -> ABAC decision -> DTO field filtering.
- InternalOnly fields must be masked or omitted from all BrokerUser responses.
- All BrokerUser reads must be broker-tenant scoped and auditable.

- Query-layer source-object filters are mandatory for rows, snippets, suggestions, facets, counts, report summaries, and drilldowns.
- Unauthorized matches are omitted and must not be exposed as hidden-record counts.
- Saved views store only criteria JSON; applying a view reruns authorization for the current user.
- Team saved views require `teamScopeType` and `teamScopeKey`; unauthorized scopes return `saved_view_scope_denied` without revealing hidden team metadata.
- Team view mutations are limited to DistributionManager, ProgramManager, and Admin for administered scopes.
- Saved-view create/update/delete/default mutations require immutable `SavedViewAuditEvent` evidence; updates/default/archive require `If-Match`.

### 2.11 Account (F0016)

Resource: `account`. Actions: `read`, `create`, `update`, `deactivate`, `reactivate`, `delete`, `merge`, `contact:manage`, `relationship:change`. See [ADR-017](../architecture/decisions/ADR-017-account-merge-tombstone-and-fallback-contract.md) for merge and tombstone contract.

| BrokerUser | all | **DENY** | No external account access in MVP. | F0016 PRD §Out of Scope |
| ExternalUser | all | **DENY** | No external account access in MVP. | F0016 PRD §Out of Scope |

**Constraints applying to all ALLOW decisions on Account:**

- Account reads and writes enforce ABAC via Casbin on resource `account`; scope predicates reuse region / territory / broker patterns from F0002 and F0007.
- Write endpoints require `If-Match` with `rowVersion`. Stale → 412.
- Lifecycle transitions must follow the state machine in F0016 PRD §Account Lifecycle Workflow; invalid transitions return 409 `code=invalid_transition`.
- Every mutation appends one `WorkflowTransition` (when lifecycle change) and one `ActivityTimelineEvent` on the account; merges append an additional mirror timeline event on the survivor.
- Dependent list/detail endpoints (submissions, renewals, policies) MUST surface `accountDisplayName`, `accountStatus`, `accountSurvivorId` denormalized per ADR-017; failure to do so is a regression.
- `includeRemoved=true` on `GET /accounts` is Admin-only; all other roles receive Active + Inactive (plus explicitly-requested Merged via filter).

## 3. InternalOnly Content Rule

All resources in this matrix are classified **InternalOnly** for MVP unless a later section explicitly layers a narrower public/document rule. No data is accessible to ExternalUser under any circumstances for Brokers, Contacts, Submissions, Renewals, Tasks, Dashboard, Timeline, Policies, Accounts, or Product Schema Registry.

Sources: BLUEPRINT §1.2 (external users are Future only), §3.1 non-goals ("No external broker/MGA self-service portal in MVP"), F0001-S0001 through F0001-S0005 Data Visibility sections, F0002-S0001 and F0002-S0002 Data Visibility sections.

Phase 1 exception (F0009): BrokerUser access can be enabled only for the explicitly broker-visible resources and actions listed in §2.10.

Phase 1 exception (F0020): Documents and document templates introduce a `public | confidential | restricted` classification model layered on parent ABAC. External roles (BrokerUser, MgaUser, ExternalUser) can only read/download `public` documents per the classification table; the parent-ABAC table in §4 is the necessary, not sufficient, condition.

---

## 4. Documents (F0020 — ADR-012 + ADR-019)

The effective access decision for any document operation is:

```
allow ⇔ parent_abac(user, parent, op)  ∧  classification_policy(role, classification, op)
```

Parent ABAC lives in `planning-mds/security/policies/policy.csv` §3 (Documents, DocumentTemplates). The classification policy lives in `<docroot>/configuration/casbin-document-roles.yaml` (a runtime configuration file, not source-of-truth code) and is validated by `planning-mds/schemas/document-classification-policy.schema.json`. Both gates must allow.

### 4.1 Document operations (parent ABAC)

| Role | read | create | replace | update_metadata | download | create:restricted | declassify |
|------|------|--------|---------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Underwriter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DistributionUser | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| DistributionManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| RelationshipManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ProgramManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Coordinator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| BrokerUser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| MgaUser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ExternalUser | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### 4.2 Document templates (parent ABAC)

| Role | read | create | replace | link |
|------|------|--------|---------|------|
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Underwriter | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| DistributionUser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| DistributionManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

| Coordinator | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| BrokerUser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| MgaUser | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| ExternalUser | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 4.3 Classification policy (default MVP table)

The runtime YAML (`<docroot>/configuration/casbin-document-roles.yaml`) is closed-by-default. The MVP default table that ships in seed data:

| Role | public | confidential | restricted |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Admin | all ops | all ops | all ops |
| Underwriter | all ops | all ops | read, download, create:restricted, declassify |
| DistributionUser, DistributionManager, RelationshipManager, ProgramManager, Coordinator | all ops except restricted | all ops except restricted | deny |
| BrokerUser, MgaUser | read, create, download | deny | deny |
| ExternalUser | read, download | deny | deny |

**Constraints applying to all ALLOW decisions on Document and DocumentTemplate:**

- The classification policy YAML is the authoritative source for the classification half of the gate; the table above is the MVP default that ships in seed data, not hardcoded in code.
- `restricted` creation requires both `document:create` and `document:create:restricted` — the latter is granted only to Admin and Underwriter in MVP.
- Declassifying a `restricted` document requires `document:declassify`; downgrades from `confidential` → `public` require `document:update_metadata` and a passing classification check on the new tier.
- Every document operation produces a sidecar JSON `events[]` row plus one `ActivityTimelineEvent` per SOLUTION-PATTERNS §2; failed authorisation never writes either.
- File ingest enforces extension allowlist (`pdf, png, docx, xlsx, csv`), 5 MB per-file cap, and 25-file / 50 MB batch cap before any byte leaves the request handler. Violations return ProblemDetails with structured `code` (`unsupported_type`, `file_too_large`, `batch_too_large`, `empty_file`, `invalid_filename`).
- Download responses are streamed (no full-buffer); resolution path is `documentId → sidecar JSON → version filename` with explicit confirmation that the resolved binary path lives inside the parent's directory before any read.

## 5. Product Schema Registry (F0034)

Product schema bundles are internal platform configuration. Runtime screens may read active bundles only after the same ABAC and tenant availability filters that govern the parent lifecycle record. Activation, deprecation, retirement, and rollback are steward/admin actions in MVP and must write activation audit rows.

| Role | read active bundles | resolve direct bundle by id | activate / deprecate / retire |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Admin | ALLOW | ALLOW | ALLOW |
| Underwriter | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| DistributionUser | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| DistributionManager | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| RelationshipManager | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| ProgramManager | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| Coordinator | ALLOW | ALLOW | DENY |
| BrokerUser | DENY | DENY | DENY |
| MgaUser | DENY | DENY | DENY |
| ExternalUser | DENY | DENY | DENY |

**Constraints applying to all ALLOW decisions on Product Schema Registry:**

- Read responses filter to tenant-available active product versions. Direct bundle reads by id are allowed for authenticated internal users so historical rows pinned to Deprecated, Retired, or Internal bundles render correctly.
- Internal sentinel bundles (`_unspecified`, `_legacy_*`, `_bridge_*`) are never returned by active bootstrap listings.
- Activation requires bundle profile validation, OpenAPI projection compatibility, HMAC signature verification, deterministic UUID verification, and an append-only activation event.
- Activation failure must not partially update product-version status or served bundle content.
- Every product schema write operation is Admin-only in MVP; a future Product Steward role requires a separate authorization update.
