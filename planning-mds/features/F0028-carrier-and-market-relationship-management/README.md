## Architecture Review

**Phase B status:** Approved for feature action
**Execution Plan:** Produced later by `agents/actions/feature.md`, not by the plan action.

### Key Findings

- F0019 and F0023 are complete, so submission context and search/reporting substrate are available dependencies.
- F0028 remains CRM-side recorded market intelligence only; carrier API sync, rating, quote comparison, and reinsurance stay out of scope.
- Security Reviewer is expected to be required because appetite, appointment, and underwriter relationship context are commercially sensitive.
- No new ADR is required; F0028 applies existing clean architecture, Casbin ABAC, timeline, search, and ProblemDetails patterns.

### Architecture Artifacts

| Artifact | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Data model / ERD | Defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| API contract (OpenAPI) | Updated in `planning-mds/api/nebula-api.yaml` |
| Workflow state machine | Not required; F0028 uses CRUD-style relationship records plus timeline events |
| Casbin policy | Updated in authorization matrix and policy CSV |
| JSON schemas | Added under `planning-mds/schemas/carrier-*.schema.json` |
| C4 diagrams | Covered by existing CRM/API container boundary; no new runtime container |
| ADRs | Not required for this slice |
| Assembly plan | Deferred to feature action G0 |
