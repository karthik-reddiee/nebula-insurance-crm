# F0032: Admin Configuration & Reference Data Console

**Feature ID:** F0032
**Feature Name:** Admin Configuration & Reference Data Console
**Priority:** Medium
**Phase:** Platform Operations

## Feature Statement

**As an** administrator
**I want** to manage configurable CRM settings and reference data
**So that** Nebula can evolve without requiring code changes for every operational tweak

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Introduce governed configurability into Nebula.
- **Metric:** Number of operational settings managed through admin tools instead of code or manual DB changes.
- **Baseline:** Early Nebula relies heavily on fixed configuration and seeded values.
- **Target:** Administrators can manage the most important configurable settings safely inside the product.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** As Nebula becomes more capable, too much operational change would otherwise require engineering intervention.
- **Desired State:** Key reference data and operational settings are managed through a controlled admin surface.
- **Impact:** Better maintainability, faster operational change, and less deployment friction.

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Reference data management
- Queue and rule configuration
- Template and workflow settings
- Operational configuration governance
- Centralized governance over module-owned configuration domains after those modules establish usable foundations

**Out of Scope:**
- First implementation of queue/routing domain objects, rule evaluation, queue worklists, reassignment, or minimal queue manager controls owned by F0022
- Unbounded low-level system administration
- Identity-provider administration
- Full infrastructure management

**Boundary Guardrail with F0022:**
- F0022 must land first with durable queue/rule records, routing behavior, and minimal manager controls.
- F0032 incorporates that foundation into a governed admin console with validation, publish, rollback, audit, and cross-module configuration patterns.
- F0032 should not require F0022 to refactor its core queue/routing model; it should govern the existing contracts.

## Success Criteria

- Administrators can manage key configurable data through Nebula.
- Engineering dependency for routine operational changes is reduced.
- Configuration changes remain governed and auditable.
- F0022 queue/rule configuration can be brought under governance without replacing the already-usable queue/routing foundation.

## Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk:** The feature arrives before there is enough configurable behavior to justify it.
- **Assumption:** It becomes more valuable after queues, templates, and reference data expand.
- **Mitigation:** Sequence it after the most important configurable capabilities exist.

## Dependencies

- F0022 Work Queues, Assignment Rules & Coverage Management
- F0023 Global Search, Saved Views & Operational Reporting

F0032 depends on F0022 for the queue/routing foundation. F0032 centralizes governance over that foundation; it is not required for the initial F0022 queue capability to function.

## Architecture & Solution Design

### Solution Components

- Introduce an admin configuration layer for reference data, queue rules, workflow settings, templates, and other governed operational configuration.
- Add configuration-management services that distinguish runtime-governed business settings from deploy-time infrastructure settings.
- Provide validation and publish flows so configuration changes can be checked before they affect live routing, search, or template behavior.
- Wrap existing module-owned configuration contracts, especially F0022 queue/rule contracts, rather than redefining each module's operational model.
- Keep identity-provider administration and deep infrastructure controls outside the scope of the product admin console.

### Data & Workflow Design

- Model reference data entries, configuration sets, rule versions, template settings, effective dates, and publish status explicitly.
- Preserve version history for configurable artifacts so the organization can answer which rule or reference set was active at a given time.
- Separate draft, validated, and published configuration states where changes can materially affect routing or outward-facing document behavior.
- Keep consuming modules dependent on stable configuration contracts rather than direct table assumptions.

### API & Integration Design

- Expose admin CRUD, validation, compare, publish, and audit endpoints for the supported configuration domains.
- Allow F0022, F0023, F0027, and other modules to consume published configuration through application-service boundaries or cached contracts rather than ad hoc shared access.
- Design configuration changes to propagate predictably, with clear cache invalidation or refresh semantics where needed.
- Keep the console focused on governed operational settings rather than becoming an unrestricted low-level system admin UI.

### Security & Operational Considerations

- Restrict configuration management to highly privileged roles because admin changes can alter routing, visibility, templates, and workflow behavior across the system.
- Require strong audit trails for create, update, validate, publish, rollback, and delete actions on configuration artifacts.
- Add safeguards against invalid publishes, conflicting reference values, and unintended rule changes through validation and preview behavior.
- Monitor publish success, downstream refresh lag, and configuration-drift incidents because this console becomes a high-leverage operational control surface.

## Related User Stories

- To be defined during refinement
- Refinement should include stories for governing F0022 queue/rule configuration after F0022 exists, not for creating the first queue/routing implementation.
