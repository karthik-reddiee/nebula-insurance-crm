## Numbering Rules

- Feature IDs use a 4-digit zero-padded format: `F0001`, `F0002`, ..., `F9999`
- Numbers are assigned sequentially — never reuse a retired number
- Story IDs within a feature follow `F{NNNN}-S{NNNN}` (e.g., `F0001-S0001`)
- Update **Next Available Feature Number** whenever a new feature is added

## Legacy Mapping

| Legacy ID | New ID |
|-----------|--------|
| F0001 | F0001 |
| F0002 | F0002 |
| F0003 | F0003 |
| F0004 | F0004 |
