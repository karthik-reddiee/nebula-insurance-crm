# F0027: COI, ACORD & Outbound Document Generation

**Feature ID:** F0027
**Feature Name:** COI, ACORD & Outbound Document Generation
**Priority:** Medium
**Phase:** CRM Release MVP+

## Feature Statement

**As a** service or distribution user
**I want** Nebula to generate insurance-specific outbound documents
**So that** the CRM can support more of the real delivery work expected in commercial P&C operations

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Add visible insurance-domain output capability to Nebula.
- **Metric:** Outbound document generation coverage and time saved preparing standard forms.
- **Baseline:** Nebula can store documents but not yet generate common outbound artifacts.
- **Target:** Users can generate key insurance-facing documents from CRM data and templates.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** Users must generate proposals, forms, and certificates outside the CRM.
- **Desired State:** Nebula can assemble core outbound insurance documents from structured data.
- **Impact:** Stronger insurance-product parity and less manual document work.

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- COI generation
- ACORD and proposal template output
- Structured data merge into outbound artifacts
- Auditability of generated documents
- Reusable template, merge-field, rendering, and generated-artifact patterns that can serve policies, accounts, submissions, and other source records

**Out of Scope:**
- Submission quote/proposal workflow state, approval readiness, packet status, and bind-decision evidence owned by F0019
- Full submission intake parsing
- OCR and extraction
- E-signature orchestration

## Success Criteria

- Users can generate common outbound insurance artifacts from Nebula.
- Generated documents reflect current structured CRM data.
- The feature builds on document and policy foundations rather than bypassing them.

## Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk:** Output generation is attempted before the underlying data model is ready.
- **Assumption:** Policy and document management foundations will exist first.
- **Mitigation:** Keep this feature sequenced after document and policy work.

## Dependencies

- F0018 Policy Lifecycle & Policy 360
- F0020 Document Management & ACORD Intake
- F0019 Submission Quoting, Proposal & Approval Workflow for submission-bound quote/proposal packet context when reusable proposal rendering is applied to submissions

F0027 should extend the submission-bound artifacts created by F0019 when reusable proposal rendering is needed; it should not become a prerequisite for F0019's quote-to-bind workflow.

## Architecture & Solution Design

### Solution Components

- Introduce a document-generation service that combines templates, CRM data assembly, and render orchestration into a dedicated outbound artifact pipeline.
- Add a template-management model for COI, ACORD, proposal, and other outbound form definitions, while keeping inbound parsing outside this feature.
- Provide generated-document audit and storage linkage so outbound artifacts become first-class records connected to policies, accounts, or submissions.
- Treat F0019 quote/proposal packets as one possible source context for rendering, not as workflow state owned by this feature.
- Keep e-signature, complex workflow routing, and external delivery orchestration outside the initial scope boundary.

### Data & Workflow Design

- Model template versions, merge-field definitions, generation requests, generated artifacts, and render outcome history explicitly.
- Separate source business data from rendered artifact records so regenerated documents remain traceable to both template version and data snapshot.
- Support draft versus issued artifact states where business meaning differs between previewed output and finalized customer-facing documents.
- Keep generated documents stored and linked through the F0020 document system instead of inventing a parallel file repository.

### API & Integration Design

- Expose preview, generate, retrieve, and regenerate endpoints with clear template and source-record references.
- Assemble merge data from authoritative modules such as policy, submission, account, and broker services rather than copying business fields into template records.
- Allow generation to run asynchronously when rendering cost or document volume warrants it, while keeping a simple synchronous contract for small operations where practical.
- Preserve clean extension points for later e-signature or distribution integrations without baking those responsibilities into the first implementation.

### Security & Operational Considerations

- Restrict template editing and artifact issuance to appropriate operational roles because outbound forms can create external business commitments.
- Audit template changes, generation actions, and final issuance events so the organization can explain which template and data produced a given artifact.
- Validate merge completeness and rendering failures explicitly because bad output is a customer-facing quality issue, not just an internal defect.
- Monitor render latency, generation failure rates, and artifact storage growth as the document library expands.

## Architecture Traceability

**Taxonomy Reference:** [Feature Architecture Traceability Taxonomy](../../architecture/feature-architecture-traceability-taxonomy.md)

| Classification | Artifact / Decision | ADR |
|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Introduces: Feature-Local Component | Template engine, merge-data assembler, render service, and generated-artifact audit | PRD only |
| Extends: Cross-Cutting Component | Generated artifacts are persisted through the shared document subsystem | [ADR-012](../../architecture/decisions/ADR-012-shared-document-storage-and-metadata-architecture.md) (Proposed) |
| Extends: Cross-Cutting Component | Template and workflow settings are governed through published operational configuration | [ADR-016](../../architecture/decisions/ADR-016-published-operational-configuration-governance.md) (Proposed) |

## Related User Stories

- To be defined during refinement
- Refinement should keep COI, generic ACORD, reusable proposal templates, and rendering concerns in F0027 while leaving submission packet status and approval workflow in F0019.
