# F0019: Submission Quoting, Proposal & Approval Workflow

**Feature ID:** F0019
**Feature Name:** Submission Quoting, Proposal & Approval Workflow
**Priority:** Critical
**Phase:** CRM Release MVP

## Feature Statement

**As an** underwriter or distribution user
**I want** to move submissions through quoting, proposal, approval, and bind decisions
**So that** Nebula supports the full commercial P&C submission journey instead of only intake

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Complete the core submission operating workflow inside Nebula.
- **Metric:** Quote turnaround time, approval-cycle time, quote-to-bind ratio, and workflow visibility.
- **Baseline:** Intake may exist, but the downstream quote and approval lifecycle is incomplete.
- **Target:** Users can manage submission progression from intake through decision with auditability.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** Submission handling is incomplete if Nebula stops at intake and triage.
- **Desired State:** Quote, proposal, approval, and final decision handling are structured and visible.
- **Impact:** Better underwriting control, faster status answers, and stronger workflow traceability.

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Submission progression from triage to quote and bind decision
- Approval checkpoints and approval visibility
- Proposal or quote package status handling
- Submission-bound quote/proposal packet record, status, and workflow evidence needed for approval and bind decisions
- Final decision states and auditable workflow transitions
- Submission archive/deactivate behavior for downstream-decided records that should leave active operational queues while preserving audit history

**Out of Scope:**
- Carrier system rating integration
- Billing and issuance accounting
- External broker self-service quoting
- Reusable outbound template engine, COI generation, and generic ACORD document generation outside the submission-bound quote/proposal packet
- Physical purge or audit-destructive deletion of submission records

**Boundary Guardrail with F0006:**
- F0006 owns the submission workflow only through `ReadyForUWReview`; it must continue to reject `ReadyForUWReview -> InReview` and all later transitions until F0019 is intentionally delivered.
- F0019 is the feature that activates downstream submission states beginning with `ReadyForUWReview -> InReview`.
- No F0006 closeout, tracker update, or UX polish should be interpreted as permission to expose downstream transitions early.
- The first refined F0019 implementation story must explicitly cover enabling downstream transitions, related authorization changes, UI exposure, and regression coverage proving the boundary moved deliberately rather than by drift.
- If F0006 descopes the unimplemented submission soft-delete requirement, F0019 becomes the owning feature for the replacement contract. That replacement must be refined as archive/deactivate behavior for appropriate downstream submission states, not as an unrestricted CRUD delete route.

**Boundary Guardrail with F0027:**
- F0019 owns the submission-bound quote/proposal packet as workflow evidence: packet status, approval readiness, document completeness, and bind handoff.
- F0027 owns reusable outbound document generation: COI, generic ACORD output, reusable proposal templates, merge-field governance, rendering, and broader generated-document audit.
- F0019 must not wait for the full F0027 template engine to move submissions through quote and bind, but its packet artifacts should remain compatible with later F0027 rendering and storage patterns.

## Success Criteria

- Users can track submission status all the way through quote and bind decision.
- Approval bottlenecks become visible and auditable.
- Submission workflow supports timely broker updates and internal accountability.

## Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk:** Workflow scope expands into carrier-side processing or document generation too early.
- **Risk:** Teams accidentally expose downstream submission transitions while closing out F0006 because the `Submission` aggregate is shared across both features.
- **Risk:** Submission removal semantics remain ambiguous after F0006 descopes soft delete, leading to accidental introduction of a generic delete endpoint without lifecycle or audit rules.
- **Assumption:** Intake, policy, and document foundations will exist before or alongside this feature.
- **Mitigation:** Keep scope centered on internal workflow orchestration and decision visibility.
- **Mitigation:** Treat `ReadyForUWReview -> InReview` enablement as an explicit F0019 deliverable with dedicated tests and signoff, not as a passive side effect of shared workflow-state changes.
- **Mitigation:** Define submission end-of-life behavior explicitly as archive/deactivate semantics tied to downstream states, list visibility, and audit retention.

## Dependencies

- F0006 Submission Intake Workflow
- F0020 Document Management & ACORD Intake
- F0018 Policy Lifecycle & Policy 360

F0019 depends on F0006 preserving the intake boundary until F0019 work is ready. As of F0006 closeout, downstream submission transitions should still return `409 invalid_transition`, and F0019 must deliberately replace that behavior when it ships.
If F0006 removes the unimplemented submission soft-delete claim during closeout, F0019 must also become the explicit owner of any future submission archive/deactivate contract.
F0027 is a future capability enhancer for reusable outbound generation, not a prerequisite for F0019's submission-bound quote/proposal packet workflow.

## Architecture & Solution Design

### Solution Components

- Extend the submission domain with dedicated quoting, proposal, approval, and decision-handling services rather than treating everything as generic status changes.
- Add an approval component that supports underwriting checkpoints, decision ownership, and future maker-checker or authority-limit logic.
- Introduce proposal or quote-package composition services that assemble documents, pricing context, and approval status into a coherent outbound working set.
- Keep the quote/proposal packet model intentionally submission-scoped so it can later delegate reusable rendering and template management to F0027 without a workflow rewrite.
- Keep final policy issuance and billing creation as downstream handoff points rather than embedding them directly into this workflow module.

### Data & Workflow Design

- Expand the submission state machine to cover downstream states such as `InReview`, `Quoted`, `BindRequested`, `Bound`, `Declined`, and `Withdrawn`, with business-approved transitions and guards.
- Activation of downstream transitions is part of F0019 delivery, not a prerequisite for it. Until F0019 implementation begins, the runtime must continue enforcing the F0006 intake-only transition set.
- Define what it means for a submission to leave active operational queues after downstream decisions, including whether archive/deactivate is allowed only for terminal states and how archived submissions remain discoverable for audit and reporting.
- Record approval requests, approval decisions, bind decisions, and workflow transitions as append-only history to preserve traceability and internal accountability.
- Store approval metadata such as approver, authority reason, decision timestamp, and blocking conditions as first-class records rather than free-form comments.
- Design for human-in-the-loop processing where workflows can wait on broker response, underwriter action, or approval authority without losing auditability.

### API & Integration Design

- Expose explicit transition, approval, quote-package, and bind-action endpoints instead of allowing unrestricted field edits on the submission record.
- If F0019 reuses the existing submission transition endpoint, refinement must explicitly document the code, authorization, and UI changes that move the boundary beyond F0006. Reuse is allowed; implicit enablement is not.
- If submission archive/deactivate behavior is introduced, prefer explicit lifecycle actions with clear state preconditions and audit semantics rather than a generic delete endpoint that hides business intent.
- Integrate with F0020 for proposal artifacts and document completeness, and with F0018 for downstream policy creation or policy-link correlation after bind.
- Emit workflow events for approval pending, approval granted, quote ready, bind requested, and final decision so notifications and reporting remain decoupled.
- Keep carrier rating, issuance accounting, and external broker self-service outside the initial API contract even if later phases integrate with them.

### Security & Operational Considerations

- Enforce authorization with role, assignment, and approval-authority context so only authorized actors can move a submission through sensitive transitions.
- Maintain separation between ordinary workflow edits and approval decisions because those actions may have different audit and review requirements.
- Ensure archive/deactivate actions cannot erase workflow evidence and are constrained to clearly authorized users and business-valid lifecycle states.
- Track workflow latency, approval-cycle time, and stuck-in-state conditions as first-class operational metrics.
- Ensure approval and bind actions are idempotent enough to handle retries or duplicate user submissions without double-processing the business outcome.

## Related User Stories

- To be defined during refinement.
- The first story must explicitly own activation of downstream transitions from `ReadyForUWReview`, with traceability back to F0006's boundary contract.
- One early story must explicitly define submission archive/deactivate semantics, including allowed states, API behavior, list visibility, and audit retention, with traceability back to F0006's descoped soft-delete claim.
- One early story must define the submission-bound quote/proposal packet lifecycle and explicitly state what remains deferred to F0027 reusable outbound document generation.
