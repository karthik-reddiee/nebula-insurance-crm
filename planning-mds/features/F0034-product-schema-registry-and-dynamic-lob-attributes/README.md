# F0034 - Product Schema Registry and Dynamic LOB Attributes

**Status:** Phase B draft pending approval
**Priority:** Critical
**Phase:** Platform Foundation / CRM Release MVP Enabler

## Overview

F0034 establishes Nebula's product-attribute foundation: governed JSON Schema bundles, schema-pinned lifecycle attributes, frontend/backend validation parity, dynamic forms, legacy-read compatibility, and a Cyber pilot. The feature exists to keep F0019 quote/proposal work and later coverage/reporting work from adding product-specific fixed fields and custom forms.

## Key Dependencies

- F0006 Submission Intake Workflow
- F0007 Renewal Pipeline
- F0018 Policy Lifecycle and Policy 360
- F0019 Submission Quoting, Proposal and Approval Workflow
- F0020 Document Management and ACORD Intake
- ADR-001 JSON Schema Validation
- ADR-018 Policy Aggregate Versioning and Reinstatement Window
- `planning-mds/architecture/lob-extensible-attribute-plan.md`

## Phase A Notes

- Cyber is the first product pilot per the existing LOB extensibility plan.
- Product attributes belong to Submission, PolicyVersion, PolicyEndorsement, and Renewal. Policy reads current attributes through PolicyVersion.
- F0019 must consume this foundation for product-specific quote/proposal attributes.

## Phase B Architecture Notes

- ADR-020 through ADR-023 are the accepted Stage 0 decision set for F0034.
- `planning-mds/api/nebula-api.yaml` defines `/lob-schemas/active`, `/lob-schemas/{productVersionId}/{stage}`, and `/lob-schemas/{productVersionId}/activate`.
- Static draft-07 schemas now carry the `lobAttributes` envelope on the attribute-carrier contracts; product-version-specific validation remains runtime-resolved.
- Authorization adds `lob_schema:read`, `lob_schema:resolve`, and Admin-only activation/deprecation/retirement actions.
