# F0022: Work Queues, Assignment Rules & Coverage Management

**Feature ID:** F0022
**Feature Name:** Work Queues, Assignment Rules & Coverage Management
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** CRM Release MVP

## Feature Statement

**As a** manager or operations lead
**I want** work queues, assignment rules, and backup coverage controls
**So that** submissions, renewals, and tasks are routed consistently and work continues when people are overloaded or unavailable

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Give Nebula an operational routing layer rather than only personal work views.
- **Metric:** Assignment latency, queue aging, rebalance frequency, and coverage continuity.
- **Baseline:** Work assignment depends too heavily on manual coordination.
- **Target:** Work can be routed, monitored, and redirected using explicit operational rules.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** Task assignment alone does not solve queue ownership, backup coverage, or workload balancing.
- **Desired State:** Queues and routing rules manage who gets work and how backup coverage behaves.
- **Impact:** Less operational friction and better continuity across submissions and renewals.

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Named work queues
- Assignment and routing rules
- Reassignment and workload balancing
- Backup coverage and out-of-office continuity
- Minimal manager/admin controls required to create, edit, and operate queues, rules, memberships, coverage, and rebalancing
- Manager-visible unassigned fallback queue for no-match routing outcomes
- Routing and reassignment audit events for every queue, rule, assignment, coverage, and rebalance mutation

**Out of Scope:**
- Centralized configuration governance, publish/rollback flows, and cross-module admin console consolidation owned by F0032
- Full workforce management
- Predictive staffing
- Advanced AI routing

**Boundary Guardrail with F0032:**
- F0022 owns the durable queue/routing foundation: queue records, assignment rules, memberships, coverage rules, rule evaluation, queue worklists, reassignment, and minimal manager controls.
- F0032 later centralizes governed configuration over queue/rule settings and other operational domains; it must not be a prerequisite for queues to function.
- F0022 should avoid throwaway seed-only configuration or UI patterns that would force F0032 to rebuild the queue/rule model.

## Success Criteria

- Managers can see and control how work is routed and covered.
- Queue aging and backlog become operationally visible.
- Teams can maintain continuity during absence or overload.
- The queue/routing feature is usable with its local controls before F0032 centralizes configuration governance.
- Routing outcomes are explainable by rule version, match reason, selected queue, selected assignee, and fallback path.

## Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk:** Queue and rule design becomes too complex before core workflows are stable.
- **Assumption:** Simple, explicit rules provide strong value before advanced automation is needed.
- **Mitigation:** Start with constrained queue types and clear rule precedence.

## Dependencies

- F0004 Task Center UI + Manager Assignment
- F0006 Submission Intake Workflow
- F0007 Renewal Pipeline
- F0017 Broker/MGA Hierarchy, Producer Ownership & Territory Management

## Business Rules

1. **Initial routed work types:** F0022 routes tasks, submissions, and renewals in the first release.
2. **Rule precedence:** Routing evaluates in this order: explicit manual assignment override, coverage/out-of-office rule, territory/ownership rule, workload balancing, fallback queue.
3. **No-match fallback:** Work that does not match an active rule is placed in a manager-visible `Unassigned Operations Queue`; it is not randomly assigned.
4. **Coverage activation:** Backup coverage activates only from explicit out-of-office or coverage windows. Inactivity alone does not activate coverage.
5. **Manual control preservation:** Authorized managers can reassign work after routing. Manual reassignment records the override reason and becomes the current assignment.
6. **Auditability:** Queue, rule, membership, coverage, routing, reassignment, rebalance, and fallback events must produce audit/timeline evidence.

## Architecture & Solution Design

### Solution Components

- Introduce a queue management module with explicit queue definitions, assignment-rule evaluation, rebalance actions, and coverage configuration services.
- Add a routing engine that determines queue placement and assignee outcomes from deterministic business rules instead of implicit manager judgment alone.
- Provide workload and backlog projections that surface queue aging, pending work, rebalance pressure, and coverage exceptions.
- Ship durable queue/rule objects and service boundaries that F0032 can later govern without replacing the foundation.
- Keep advanced AI routing out of the first architecture so the operating model remains transparent and debuggable.

### Data & Workflow Design

- Model queues, queue membership, routing rules, coverage rules, and assignment outcomes as separate concepts so rule administration and execution history remain explainable.
- Make routing decisions auditable by storing rule version, matched conditions, selected queue, and selected assignee on assignment events.
- Represent out-of-office and backup coverage as explicit configuration, not ad hoc user preferences embedded in unrelated profile data.
- Preserve deterministic rule precedence and fallback order so submissions, renewals, and tasks are routed consistently under retry or replay conditions.

### API & Integration Design

- Expose queue administration, queue worklist, reassignment, rebalance, and coverage-management endpoints with consistent resource semantics.
- Consume events or state changes from submissions, renewals, and tasks to trigger routing decisions rather than hard-coding module-specific entry points everywhere.
- Keep routing execution behind an application-service boundary so the same rules can be invoked synchronously for user actions or asynchronously for background rebalancing.
- Allow F0032 to become the governed administrative control surface for queue rules later without requiring this feature to redesign its execution model or data contracts.

### Security & Operational Considerations

- Restrict queue and reassignment powers by manager or admin authorization because routing actions can materially change workload ownership and data visibility.
- Instrument rule evaluation latency, queue aging, backlog size, rebalance frequency, and no-match exceptions as core operational metrics.
- Design assignment operations to be idempotent enough to survive repeated upstream events without duplicate queue entries or churn.
- Plan indexing and partitioning around queue status, owner, due date, and work type because queues will become hot operational datasets.
